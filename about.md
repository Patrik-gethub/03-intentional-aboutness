## Patrik

My name is Patrik, I was born in Prague, currently studying at University of Creative communication, it's my 3rd and last year here.

As I said, my name is Patrik and in my free time, I like to play musical instruments (guitar, piano, bass, didgeridoo, ukulele, cajon). I also found myself
in a sport called Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which is a very fun sport. I also like to take walks to nature and meditate. In the future I would like to work
with music and graphics and combine those two fields.
